#Web application name:    Job Engine

#Application Description: 
 
#Our application aims to provide the job matching for the employers who are hunting for fully skilled employees and employees who are seeking for job opportunity. Employers could post job with the necessary requirements, and job seeker could find the posting job which is related to their qualifications and skills through the job matching systems.

#-How finding job problem solved currently (if at all)? 

#Looking for a job online is getting popular now.  Most online job searching basically ask employers to post a job or let users to search jobs through the whole website. It is not a easy work to users to find the jobs or the employees  which could match their requirement. In the other world, users has low efficiency  for getting the expected information.  

#The main problems of information searching website are that low efficiency of getting useful information and bad user experience from the complex web page, which would make user feel the page is messy and can’t get information as they need. Asking details of users’ demand might make users feel too much work to do which is a not great solution for web application development.  

#Designing a unique online job searching is the goal of this group project. The goal of Job Engine web application is increasing the possibility for users to find the expected information by having clear and separating job models. 

#Job Engine would create an accurate and detailed job searching serving system to help users to find the job that they really need. For example, Job Engine provides international jobs, Co-op jobs and high paid jobs sections to meet different demand from users. 

#Job Engine will try to avoid bad user experience as well by applying clear and new UI design. The separating job models will solve this problem as well. Using blocks for specific section of job instead of giving tales all the time.


#2.How will this project make life easier? 

##Our application is mainly focused on the employment. Later on, we will add some more features that might broaden the range of our customers, but for now it is designed for those who are seeking job and companies who need employees.
 

#3. Who is the target audience? Who will use your product? 

#Our customers who want to hire employees can post their job advertisements easily through our application. They can provide any detailed information about employment or their company to make their postings more interesting, valuable and unique. Based on those databases created by the employers, the users who want to find a job can easily access to the various information. They can search companies in particular areas by using google map or compare salaries of different companies. They can use many other useful features such as uploading his/her resume through our application and transferring it directly to their desired company or sending an email for inquiries. Also, Intuitive user interface will help the users to understand our application and utilize it in more convenient way.

#5. What are some sample stories/scenarios? For example, as a regular user to your site, what types of things can I do? As an admin for your site? These are the ‘stories’ of your project. 
     
#Story 1: As a regular user for our website, I want to find a full-time, part-time or co-op job online and I have no idea which job are good for me, then I go to Job Engine. First, I could choose which type of jobs I want to work, there would be some options and requirements list I need to fill up, for example, the work type, the work time and work place, etc. Second, The pages come out a list of jobs which fit my requirement, I could find the job from the list. Third, I go into the job page, I could find the complete job information, and I also could see the company location according to Google map. Third, if I logged in, I could save the job information and send this job into my job prefer list which could find in my account page. What’s more, I also want to know the income ranking of all the jobs, there also can tell me this job is higher or lower than the average of the whole industry, then I can have a general acquaintance.

#Story 2: As a user who already finished steps in the story 1, but I also can’t find my favorite job, I can go to the Waiting for hire page, post my own advertisement which would contains my basic contact information, job skills, education background, work record, and my preference. In this way, the companies and instructions could choose the people who they actually need. While there is a company want to interview me, they are easy to contact with me by these information. Except that, they also could leave message in Job Engine site, and next time I log in, I could see all the message from the companies. 

#Story 3: As a user who actually know which job they want, I could directly use the search function of the website, using the keyword to search related companies and jobs list, then I could go to the company pag. From that page, the complete their information and the requirement of that job would be found. Finally, I could contact with the company about the job I want.

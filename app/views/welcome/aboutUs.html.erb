      <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
      <p>Looking for a job online is getting popular now. Most online job searching basically ask employers to post a job or let users to search jobs through the whole website. It is not a easy work to users to find the jobs or the employees which could match their requirement. In the other world, users has low efficiency for getting the expected information.</p>
      <p>Designing a unique online job searching is the goal of this group project. The goal of Job
Engine web application is increasing the possibility for users to find the expected information
by having clear and separating job models.</p>
      <p>Job Engine would create an accurate and detailed job searching serving system to help users to find the job that they really need. For example, Job Engine provides international jobs, Co-op jobs and high paid jobs sections to meet different demand from users.</p>
<p>Job Engine will try to avoid bad user experience as well by applying clear and new UI design. The separating job models will solve this problem as well. Using blocks for specific section of job instead of giving tales all the time.
